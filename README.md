# Meridian 7.4.1.0

This is my fork of [Stealth2012's Meridian-UWP, Desktop Edition](https://github.com/artemshuba/meridian-uwp).

So, this is the UWP version for Windows 10/Mobile (min. os. build: 10240).

## About
Meridian is a music player which allows you to listen to music from popular Russian social network [vk.com](https://vk.com). 

It communicates with some additional services like [deezer.com](http://deezer.com) and [last.fm](http://last.fm) 
to bring to you some advanced features: recommendations, artists and albums search and other.

## My 2 cents
- Absolute Dark Theme now ok (for low-energy deals)
- Friend's Music mode - ok
- Explore mode - not fixed yet 
- Astoria 10240 - successfully compiled but app don t want to start :(

## The fields to explore
- Explore mode (getCatalog emulation via getRecommendetaions)
- Astoria compatibility
- RemoteKit (RemoteCore + RemoteServer)
